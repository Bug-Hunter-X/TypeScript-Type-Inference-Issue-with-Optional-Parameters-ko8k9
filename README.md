This repository demonstrates a subtle type inference issue in TypeScript related to optional parameters.  The `calculate` function showcases this.  When an optional parameter is omitted and no default is provided, TypeScript's type inference can become less precise.  The solution demonstrates how to improve type safety and predictability by providing a default value or using type assertions where appropriate. This can prevent runtime errors and improve code maintainability.
